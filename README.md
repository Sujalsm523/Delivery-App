# Sustainable Delivery üööüå±

A community-driven delivery platform that turns neighbors' regular errands into sustainable, rewarding opportunities to deliver packages.

---

## üéØ The Problem

Traditional last-mile delivery is inefficient, environmentally costly, and lacks community connection. It creates unnecessary traffic, carbon emissions, and high costs for single-purpose trips.

##üí° Our Solution

Sustainable Delivery solves this by creating a peer-to-peer network where verified local volunteers deliver packages along their existing routes. Our platform uses smart technology to match deliveries with volunteers, creating a system that is efficient, rewarding, and good for the planet.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Smart Matching:** An algorithm connects package requests with the most efficient volunteer routes.
- **Real-time Tracking:** Live GPS tracking for all deliveries from store to door.
- **Community Trust:** A robust verification and peer-to-peer rating system.
- **Gamified Rewards:** Volunteers earn credits and unlock badges for successful deliveries.
- **Impact Tracking:** Users can see their direct contribution to reducing carbon emissions.
- **Flexible Scheduling:** Recipients can set preferred delivery windows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Backend & Database:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Functions)
- **Mapping:** Leaflet & React-Leaflet
- **AI Features:** Gemini API
